# Visualizing Recent Earthquakes Using USGS GeoJSON Data

This project visualizes recent earthquake data using a free dataset from the US Geological Survey (USGS). It uses Python and Plotly to display an interactive map where each earthquake is represented by a marker. 
The marker's size and color correspond to the earthquake's magnitude, giving a visual impression of earthquake distribution and intensity.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pathlib
- json
- plotly

## Dataset
The earthquake data is sourced from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program and is available in GeoJSON format. You can download recent earthquake data 

# Project Workflow
### 1. Import Libraries
We use pathlib for file paths, json for parsing the GeoJSON data, and plotly.graph_objects for creating the visualization.

- import json
- from pathlib import Path as p
- import plotly.express as px

### 2. Load GeoJSON Data
Use pathlib.Path to create a path object and load the data into a Python dictionary.

### 3. Extract Data
